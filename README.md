#### About
I'm a new developer coming into the tech industry through the frustrations of working with poorly developed software and being sure enough to think that I can help us do better. I've worked in the financial, automotive, and manufacturing industries, which has helped my understanding in product management, and user experience. Outside of my work, I enjoy training and competing in powerlifting competitions.
